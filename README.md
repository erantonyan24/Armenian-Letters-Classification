# 🇦🇲 Mashtots Dataset v2 – Armenian Handwritten Letter Classification ✍️

## 📌 Overview

This project is built around the **Mashtots Dataset v2**, a Kaggle competition focused on classifying **Armenian handwritten letters**.
The dataset was developed by the Automation Systems & Modeling Laboratory at the **National Polytechnic University of Armenia** and is widely used in education and research.

## 📂 Dataset Details

* **🎯 Task**: Classification of Armenian handwritten characters.
* **🏛 Origin**: Created by the Basic Research Laboratory of Automation Systems & Modeling, NPUA, with support from the Science and Technology Foundation of Armenia.
* **📊 Structure**:

  * **Train**: \~70,060 grayscale images (64×64 px) across **78 classes**.
  * **Test**: \~50,000 images (some with incorrect labels for fraud detection).
* **💡 Use Cases**: Benchmark for CNN-based vision models & educational purposes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* 🧠 Build a high-accuracy handwritten letter classifier.
* 🔬 Experiment with architectures like **ResNet**, **VGG**, and **SpinalNet**.
* 📈 Improve accuracy with **image augmentation** (rotation, noise, perspective shifts).

## 🚀 Usage

1. 📥 **Download the dataset** from Kaggle and place it under `data/`.
2. 🔄 **Preprocess the data**:

   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py --data-dir data/
   ```
3. 🏋️ **Train the model**:

   ```bash
   python src/train.py --architecture resnet --epochs 50
   ```
4. 📊 **Evaluate performance**:

   ```bash
   python src/train.py --evaluate --model-path models/resnet_best.pth
   ```

## 📈 Results & Insights

*(Update with your actual metrics, confusion matrix, and leaderboard rank.)*

Example:
✅ **ResNet50** – 97.8% accuracy
✅ **VGG16** – 96.5% accuracy

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* 🖌️ More diverse data augmentations (brightness, warping, synthetic data).
* 🤖 Try transformer-based architectures (ViT, Swin).
* 🌐 Deploy as a real-time web app for instant letter recognition.
